## Overview
This is a business analysis to help W. Avy understand whether or not investing and opening a surf and ice cream shop on the island of Oahu will be a good investment. This analysis will also attempt to find investors for the venture. A business plan has already been presented but the potential investors have asked for further analysis around the weather on the island as it has impacted previous ventures on the island.

## Results
The analysis looks at two key months of the year that have varying temperatures (as varying as they can be in Hawaii).
Temperatures were taken from various places from around the island throughout each month. Both months have an excess of 1,500 readings, which gives us a good data sample, or 54 readings each day. Here are some data points for review:

* For both months the average temperature is above 70 degrees.
* The low has a larger variance at 8 degrees; however, this is the minimum temperature for each month and not the average low.
* The high temperature goes up over 80 degrees in each month. Again, this is the highest temperature for the month and not the average high.

## Summary  
In summary, the venture is looking promising. It would be good to get more data around the temperatures and the amount of rain that the island has each year. 

Also, to do some research around the months where the tourism volume is the highest. This will give us a better idea if we should not only do the venture, but also if it makes sense to have the business be seasonal, closing during the slowest months. 

The investors will want to do more surfing when there are not as many visitors on the beach.
